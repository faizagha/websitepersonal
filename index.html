      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <p>My name is Faiz Agha, a student at<a href="https://rvce.edu.in/">RVCE</a> currently in my first year of my bachelor's degree in electronic communication.</p>
      <p>I've been interested in programming from the first day that i tried it and i've been learning for 3 or 4 months and although i've tried C and C++ but i've found
      that python is the one that works best for me.</p>
      <p>All the projects that i've made will be available with demonstrations at the project section of the website.
      So if you want to have a look at my projects you can go there.</p>
      <p>This website is a project made by me while i'm learning web development and thus will be changing constantly with time</p>
